# Understanding Throttling in Azure Storage: A Fun Customer Support Scenario

## Introduction:

In the world of cloud storage, performance issues can sometimes slow down your operations, much like a traffic jam on a busy highway. One common culprit is throttling, which occurs when your storage account exceeds the allowed limits for Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) or throughput. To help you understand this concept better, let's dive into a fun and engaging dialog between Evelyn, a customer, and Adam, a support representative. This scenario will illustrate how throttling works and what steps can be taken to resolve it. Enjoy the conversation and learn how to keep your Azure Storage running smoothly!
