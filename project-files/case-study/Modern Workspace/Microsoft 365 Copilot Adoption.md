# Fabrikam’s Transformation: Microsoft 365 Copilot Adoption

In Latin America, Fabrikam, a mobility leader, undertook a project to boost customer engagement and efficiency by using Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Challenge
Fabrikam aimed to enhance productivity, streamline operations, and promote inclusivity with the help of AI-driven solutions.

## Strategies for Adoption
- **User Enablement**: Empowered employees through targeted training, resources, and support to maximize AI’s potential.
- **Three-Part AI Approach**: Focused on leadership development, human transformation via robust enablement programs, and building technical skills.
- **People-First Strategy**: Emphasized human connection, leadership support, and emotional consideration during adoption.
- **Executive Alignment**: Clear vision and active support from leaders and peers ensured goal alignment and collaboration.
- **Copilot Center of Excellence (CoE)**: Fostered peer learning, rapid feedback, and a virtual community for sharing ideas and support.

## Key Successes
- **Productivity Boost**: Employees saved an average of 8.3 hours per month, with heavy users saving up to 25 hours, achieving a 10.6% productivity increase.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Tasks like customer feedback analysis and crisis response were completed in hours instead of days.
- **Inclusivity**: Real-time transcription and summaries enabled hearing-impaired employees to participate actively in meetings.
- **Crisis Management**: Streamlined emergency responses with Teams discussions and automated reports.

## Measuring Success
- Tracked KPIs and adoption metrics using the Copilot Dashboard.
- Conducted surveys and feedback sessions to gauge user satisfaction.
- Reviewed usage reports and held feedback campaigns for continuous improvement.

## Future Plans
Fabrikam aims to scale AI adoption with 42 use cases identified in pilots, expand Copilot use across departments, and explore tools like Microsoft Copilot for Finance.
