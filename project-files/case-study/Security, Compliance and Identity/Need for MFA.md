# Need for Multi Factor Authentication

## Introduction
In today's digital age, securing sensitive information has become more critical than ever. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security measure that requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before accessing an account or system. This case study explores the importance of MFA in enhancing security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, and protecting against various cyber threats. Through a detailed analysis of a real-world scenario, we will understand how MFA can be effectively implemented to safeguard organizational data and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
