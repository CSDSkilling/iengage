# Enhancing a Customer Support Chatbot with RAG and Fine Tuning

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced digital world, customer support chatbots play a crucial role in providing timely and accurate assistance to users. However, as products and services evolve, these chatbots often struggle to keep up with the latest information and handle complex queries effectively. This case study explores the challenges faced by a customer support team and how they can leverage advanced AI techniques to improve their chatbot's performance.

## Scenario
Alex and Jamie, two colleagues working in the customer support department of a tech company, are tasked with enhancing their chatbot's capabilities. The chatbot has been underperforming, particularly with queries that require up-to-date information and a deep understanding of the company's products and services. Alex and Jamie are considering two AI techniques: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, but they are unsure which one to use.
