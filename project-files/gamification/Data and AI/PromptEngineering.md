# Prompt Engineering

## Introduction

Two colleagues Alex and Taylor are exploring the fascinating world of prompt engineering through a conversation. 
One of them is an expert in the field, while the other is a novice eager to learn. 
Through their interactions, the expert will teach the novice various techniques of prompt engineering. 
As they discuss and practice these techniques, the novice will gain a deeper understanding of how to craft effective prompts that can elicit accurate and useful responses from AI models.

**Writing a clear, concise, and specific prompt:**
1.	Instead of just saying "Summarize this," you could say, "Please provide a concise summary of the main points in this document."
2.	Another example of Summarization- "Rewrite the introduction and conclusion of this document to be more concise while preserving the main point”
3.	While asking a question - "Explain how user authentication works in web applications for a beginner in web development”
**Providing clear context, and specifying the format of the output:**
1.	Providing Context: "As a 7th-grade science student, explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms”
2.	Transcribe your meetings the right way: "Analyze this meeting transcript and summarize the meeting, especially all the key points made by a particular person.
3.	Specify the output format: "Provide a detailed summary of my recent emails about Copilot, output as a table with 4 columns: time, sender, description, did I respond to it”
