# Understanding ADF Integration Runtime

## Introduction:
In this conversation, Jack, who is working on a data migration project, seeks Rose's expertise to understand Azure Data Factory's integration runtime. Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation. The integration runtime (IR) is a critical component of ADF, providing the compute infrastructure needed to perform these tasks. Jack is curious about the different types of integration runtimes available and their specific use cases. Rose, with her extensive knowledge of Azure services, explains the three types of integration runtimes—Azure, Self-hosted, and Azure-SSIS—and provides practical examples of when to use each one.
